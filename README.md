#### 1.4.1 Pay-per-click (PPC) Business Model

For some mobile applications (ios or Android), they are using Pay-per-click (PPC) model, which will help direct traffic to their applications. Genearlly speaking, they want to increase the number of downloads using internet advertising companys. If users click this advertisment, the advertising company will charge based on each click. 

Overall, higher click volume will lead to high download rate. This part is related to **Click-through rate (CTR)**.

**Motivation to cheat:** High Click Times will increase these company's income but the application download times will not increase.
